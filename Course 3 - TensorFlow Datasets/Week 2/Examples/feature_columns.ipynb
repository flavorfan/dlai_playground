We cannot feed strings directly to a model. Instead, we must first map them to numeric values. The categorical vocabulary columns provide a way to represent strings as a one-hot vector (much like you have seen above with age buckets). The vocabulary can be passed as a list using [categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list), or loaded from a file using [categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DJ6QnSHkPtOC"},"source":["thal = feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(\n","      'thal', ['fixed', 'normal', 'reversible'])\n","\n","thal_one_hot = feature_column.indicator_column(thal)\n","demo(thal_one_hot)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"T3NndNt23uCT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602557513891,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":1027,"user":{"displayName":"fan chuankang","photoUrl":"","userId":"08203141907222754677"}},"outputId":"b9aca225-e471-499f-f3e7-4d5382274682","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["thal"],"execution_count":36,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["VocabularyListCategoricalColumn(key='thal', vocabulary_list=('fixed', 'normal', 'reversible'), dtype=tf.string, default_value=-1, num_oov_buckets=0)"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":36}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"C_al3L4Q3zPJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602557530385,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":958,"user":{"displayName":"fan chuankang","photoUrl":"","userId":"08203141907222754677"}},"outputId":"626221ae-9380-4af3-d0c2-d40a79fe3427","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":54}},"source":["thal_one_hot"],"execution_count":37,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["IndicatorColumn(categorical_column=VocabularyListCategoricalColumn(key='thal', vocabulary_list=('fixed', 'normal', 'reversible'), dtype=tf.string, default_value=-1, num_oov_buckets=0))"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":37}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dxQloQ9jOoXL"},"source":["In a more complex dataset, many columns would be categorical (e.g. strings).

For a number of reasons, as the number of categories grow large, it becomes infeasible to train a neural network using one-hot encodings. We can use an embedding column to overcome this limitation. Instead of representing the data as a one-hot vector of many dimensions, an [embedding column](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/embedding_column) represents that data as a lower-dimensional, dense vector in which each cell can contain any number, not just 0 or 1. The size of the embedding (8, in the example below) is a parameter that must be tuned.\n","\n","Key point: using an embedding column is best when a categorical column has many possible values.

When using this column, you do not need to provide the vocabulary, and you can choose to make the number of hash_buckets significantly smaller than the number of actual categories to save space.\n","\n","Key point: An important downside of this technique is that there may be collisions in which different strings are mapped to the same bucket.
